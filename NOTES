* Why is GcrCertificateChooserDialog not more like the GtkDialog?
  In particular the action area could look more like the stock one, with the button bar, etc.
  Also, a separate _dialog_run() is probably not needed?

* #include "gcr-certificate-chooser-pkcs11.c"

* A lot of missing g_free()s

* Should a certificate and key choice emit different signals?

* stored_uri & stored_password are global variables

* Should the button indicate a key is chosen?
